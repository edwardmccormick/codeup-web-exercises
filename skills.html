<h3>Leadership</h3>
<p>Everyone can sail when the seas are calm - if your organization is heading into stormy weather, though, you want a steady hand at the tiller. Someone who has seen the eye of the storm before, and come out the other side.</p>
<p>In my time in the Navy, I led Sailors all across the world, in dangerous situations, with real risks and real stakes. It wasn't always lives on the line - sometimes it was equipment, sometimes it was our pride. But having that experience on your team could be the difference between a successful development cycle and deployment, and a lot of wasted time and effort.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>Clear. Concise. You need team members that focus on your priorities, without forgetting about the details. And you need to know that you're getting the same back from your team. When the winds are highest, you need a voice that can cut through the storm, calm the nerves, and keep everyone moving forward.</p>
<p>Through four years in Annapolis, six years in the Navy, and the almost ten years since then, I've been lucky enough to get a lot of practice in what one of my former superiors called, "Command voice." Using words to not only draw out their meaning, but to motivate, to calm, to reinvigorate, and hopefully even occasionally inspire.</p>

<h3>Hard skills</h3>
<p>You can't build a web application, or a website, or a database with stirring words and a can-do attitude - although good luck building anything without those tools. I'm well versed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, JQuery, Java, MySQL, and Spring/Springboot.</p>
<p>Which is great - but what you really want to know is that every step of my career, I've had to take in large amounts of new information and new skills and continue to grow and expand my skills. So while I'm well versed in them now, I'm also continuing to get better - through coding challenges, hackathons, and seeking out opportunities to implement new solutions. I'll also be able to adjust and learn whatever frameworks, systems, and languages that you're using. I won't know them the first day - although I'll work hard before my first day to be ready - but I'll keep working until I'm where I need to be, no matter what the challenges there may be.</p>
