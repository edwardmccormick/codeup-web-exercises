<h3>Yellowstone National Park</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Yellowstone National Park was established on March 1, 1872.</li>
    <li>Yellowstone is the worldâ€™s first national park.</li>
    <li>3,472 square miles (8,991 km2)</li>
    <li>More than 1,800 known archeological sites</li>
</ul>

<h3>Grand Canyon National Park</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Grand Canyon of the Colorado River is a mile-deep canyon (1.6 km) that bisects the park.</li>
    <li>Even though the average distance across the canyon is only 10 miles/ 16 km, it takes 5 hours to drive the 215 miles / 346 km between the park's South Rim Village and the North Rim Village.</li>
    <li>90% of Travelers Visit Grand Canyon National Park's South Rim</li>
    <li>The South Rim of Grand Canyon averages 7000 feet/2134 m above sea level.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Yosemite National Park</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It depends what you're looking for! While most people visit Yosemite during summer, there are advantages to visiting throughout the year.</li>
    <li>There are three giant sequoia groves in Yosemite National Park: the Mariposa Grove, the Tuolumne Grove, and the Merced Grove.</li>
    <li>Frazil ice forms along Yosemite Creek, and some other creeks in Yosemite Valley, most commonly in March and April. The phenomenon is entirely weather-dependent, so it's difficult to know when exactly it may happen (or if it will happen at all).</li>
    <li>Horsetail Fall flows in winter and early spring, when snow is present on top of El Capitan. On sunny afternoons in mid- to late February, the setting sun can cause it to glow orange.</li>
</ul>
