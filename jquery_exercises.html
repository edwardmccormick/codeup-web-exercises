<h1 id="toptitle" class="heading">I love you, buddy!</h1>
<p>Ummm…to eBay? Meh. No. We're on the top. Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock. And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>
<p>Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. And I'm his friend Jesus. I can explain. <strong> It's very valuable.</strong> <em> Bender?!</em> You stole the atom.</p>
<h2>Guess again.</h2>
<p>I had more, but you go ahead. Noooooo! Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Meh.</p>

</ol>

<h3 class="heading codeup">Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you!</h3>
<p>Really?! Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool.</p>
<ul id="list2" class="list-group codeup">

    <li>Bender?! You stole the atom.</li><li>You're going to do his laundry?</li><li>We're also Santa Claus!</li>

</ul>

<p>Now what? Pansy. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat. When will that be?</p>
<p>Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Professor, make a woman out of me. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.</p>
<p>Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.</p>
<p>Bender, you risked your life to save me! We're also Santa Claus! Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Ask her how her day was. You don't know how to do any of those. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</p>
<p>Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Oh right. I forgot about the battle. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.</p>
<p>Leela's gonna kill me. They're like sex, except I'm having them! Why yes! Thanks for noticing. Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? I can explain. It's very valuable.</p>
<p>That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>
<p>Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</p>
<p>OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him! How much did you make me? Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.</p>
<p>Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! I saw you with those two "ladies of the evening" at Elzars. Explain that. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!</p>
<p id='bottomgraf' class="codeup">Soothe us with sweet lies. Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>
