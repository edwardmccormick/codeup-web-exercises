<h1>This is a work in progress</h1>
<p>Much like the author. Nothing on this website should break your web browser, but in many cases the 'exciting part' is happening either in your Javascript Console or a CSS page. Proceed at your own discretion.</p>
<p>These links are unordered - the first fifteen or so are haphazard from the first 5 weeks of the bootcamp I'm in, the rest I will <s>probably forget to</s> add mostly as we complete them.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="conditionals.html">This is mostly Javascript i.e. nothing to see, really.</a></li>
    <li><a href="functions_js.html">Yeah, almost 100% JS. Check the console if you know how?</a> </li>
    <li><a href="iterating_arrays_js.html">Almost all Javascript.</a></li>
    <li><a href="planets_js.html">The same, but with planets.</a> </li>
    <li><a href="split-join.html">The same, but splitting and joining arrays.</a> </li>
    <li><a href="objects.html">The same, but objects.</a> </li>
    <li><a href="loops.html">Same here. Loops will, only about 25% of the time, crash your browser if I write them wrong.</a> </li>
    <li><a href="login-form.html">A login form (that doesn't submit)</a>. Although I did a little extra on this one and kind of like it, so take that with a grain of salt. </li>
    <li><a href="welcome.html">A welcome page?</a> This one is actually kind of nice - the color palette is a little strange, but it's like the 1998 Internet came back around. I'm pretty sure there's fairly minimal CSS here.</li>
    <li><a href="css_selectors.html">Let there be COLORS!</a> </li>
    <li><a href="messages.html">This is just messages.</a> There's not anything that like, makes them come up or anything - it was just to practice styling them.</li>    <li><a href="flexbox-fundamentals-exercises.html"> This one is actually a little responsive.</a> Try resizing your window to see how it responds. Or look it up on mobile, I guess? Seems like a lot of work to enjoy it though.</li>
    <li><a href="github.html">I guess we made Github?</a> </li>
    <li><a href="twitter.html">And then we made Twitter</a> </li>
    <li><a href="flex-form.html">A form in flexbox?</a> I'll be honest, I'm not entirely sure what this one is for. But it has a puppy playing on the beach, so that's cool.</li>
    <li><a href="flexbox-nav-exercise.html">I honestly didn't remember this one.</a> It's an...ugly, non-functional navbar. But it is responsive.</li>
    <li><a href="forms.html">Forms. That lead to nowhere.</a> I actually kind of have a soft spot for this one - it's got some nice styling to it and an animated submit button and a neat 'password reveal' function. One of my early, simple favorites.</li>
    <li><a href="bootstrap-resume.html">It's a responsive resume.</a> Not mine (yet) but again, change the size of your browser window and see it adjust. I am moderately proud of this one.</li>
    <li><a href="order-pizza.html">It's a pizza order form</a>, done almost entirely in Bootstrap, and honestly, I'm pretty proud of this one. It doesn't submit but has some fun features (like a login on the menu bar). It's also responsive - change your browser and watch it adjust.</li>
    <li><a href="pairs-programming-bootstrap.html">I'm actually pretty proud of this one.</a> It's a responsive (i.e. shrinks down for mobile, expands for desktop) page I built with a partner from wireframes. None of it is functional, but it's <em>very</em> pretty and kind of technically cool too. A fair bit of Bootstrap, with CSS for specific styling and few technical details.</li>
    <li><a href="defuse-the-bom.html">This is kind of a weird little game.</a> I like it because it uses Javascript to rewrite the HTML (and add time to a timer) but it's not exactly revolutionary.</li>
    <li><a href="dom-query-js.html">Look, rewriting css styles with Javascript isn't sexy.</a> And honestly, there's not much about this I love. I almost left it out.</li>
</ul>
