The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.‚Äù</p>

<p>Nothing on this website should break your web browser, but in many cases the 'exciting part' is happening either in your Javascript Console or a CSS page. Proceed at your own discretion.</p>
<p>These links are unordered - the first fifteen or so are haphazard from the first 5 weeks of the bootcamp I'm in, the rest I will <s>probably forget to</s> add mostly as we complete them.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="conditionals.html">This is mostly Javascript i.e. nothing to see, really.</a></li>
    <li><a href="functions_js.html">Yeah, almost 100% JS. Check the console if you know how?</a> </li>
    <li><a href="iterating_arrays_js.html">Almost all Javascript.</a></li>
    <li><a href="planets_js.html">The same, but with planets.</a> </li>
    <li><a href="split-join.html">The same, but splitting and joining arrays.</a> </li>
    <li><a href="objects.html">The same, but objects.</a> </li>
    <li><a href="loops.html">Same here. Loops will, only about 25% of the time, crash your browser if I write them wrong.</a> </li>
    <li><a href="login-form.html">A login form (that doesn't submit)</a>. Although I did a little extra on this one and kind of like it, so take that with a grain of salt. </li>
    <li><a href="welcome.html">A welcome page?</a> This one is actually kind of nice - the color palette is a little strange, but it's like the 1998 Internet came back around. I'm pretty sure there's fairly minimal CSS here.</li>
    <li><a href="css_selectors.html">Let there be COLORS!</a> </li>
    <li><a href="messages.html">This is just messages.</a> There's not anything that like, makes them come up or anything - it was just to practice styling them.</li>    <li><a href="flexbox-fundamentals-exercises.html"> This one is actually a little responsive.</a> Try resizing your window to see how it responds. Or look it up on mobile, I guess? Seems like a lot of work to enjoy it though.</li>
    <li><a href="github.html">I guess we made Github?</a> </li>
    <li><a href="twitter.html">And then we made Twitter</a> </li>
    <li><a href="flex-form.html">A form in flexbox?</a> I'll be honest, I'm not entirely sure what this one is for. But it has a puppy playing on the beach, so that's cool.</li>
    <li><a href="flexbox-nav-exercise.html">I honestly didn't remember this one.</a> It's an...ugly, non-functional navbar. But it is responsive.</li>
    <li><a href="forms.html">Forms. That lead to nowhere.</a> I actually kind of have a soft spot for this one - it's got some nice styling to it and an animated submit button and a neat 'password reveal' function. One of my early, simple favorites.</li>
    <li><a href="bootstrap-resume.html">It's a responsive resume.</a> Not mine (yet) but again, change the size of your browser window and see it adjust. I am moderately proud of this one.</li>
    <li><a href="order-pizza.html">It's a pizza order form</a>, done almost entirely in Bootstrap, and honestly, I'm pretty proud of this one. It doesn't submit but has some fun features (like a login on the menu bar). It's also responsive - change your browser and watch it adjust.</li>
    <li><a href="pairs-programming-bootstrap.html">I'm actually pretty proud of this one.</a> It's a responsive (i.e. shrinks down for mobile, expands for desktop) page I built with a partner from wireframes. None of it is functional, but it's <em>very</em> pretty and kind of technically cool too. A fair bit of Bootstrap, with CSS for specific styling and few technical details.</li>
    <li><a href="defuse-the-bom.html">This is kind of a weird little game.</a> I like it because it uses Javascript to rewrite the HTML (and add time to a timer) but it's not exactly revolutionary.</li>
    <li><a href="dom-query-js.html">Look, rewriting css styles with Javascript isn't sexy.</a> The buttons are kind of cool though - my first real experience playing with JS/HTML/CSS integration.</li>
