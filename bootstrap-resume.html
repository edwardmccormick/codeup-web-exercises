        <h5 class="card-title">Professional Experience</h5>
        <h6>Job 2</h6>
        <p class="card-text">I love you, buddy! So, how 'bout them Knicks? Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!</p>
<h6>Job 1</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans! Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!</p>

</div>

    <div class="col-12 col-md-8">
        <h5 class="card-title">Development Projects</h5>

        <h6>Project 3</h6>
        <p class="card-text">Large bet on myself in round one. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. It's a T. It goes "tuh". Belligerent and numerous.</p>

        <h6>Project 2</h6>
        <p class="card-text">Ummmâ€¦to eBay? Hello, little man. I will destroy you! That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!</p>

        <h6>Project 1</h6>
        <p class="card-text">Belligerent and numerous. Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think? As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Now what?</p>

                <h5 class="card-title">Awards and Involvement</h5>

                <h6>Award 1</h6><br>
                <p class="card-text">Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Bender, quit destroying the universe! When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two consenting adults.</p>

                <h6>Award 2</h6><br>
                <p class="card-text">Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.</p>

                <h6>Involvement 1</h6><br>
                <p class="card-text">Ask her how her day was. But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Shut up and get to the point!</p>
                <p>And then the battle's not so bad? Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
